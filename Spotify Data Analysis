-- In this project, I analyzed a table containing data on the top spotify songs..

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Below are a series of questions I used to create SQLs to query the database.

-- Question #1: How does a song's "loudness" influence its popularity and ranking?

SELECT round(avg(loudness))
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

-- I created the above query to find the average amount of loudness for a frame of reference.

SELECT id, track_name, popularity, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc


-- Question #2: In what way, if any, does a song's danceability and energy correlate?

SELECT round(danceability, 2) as danceability, round(energy,2) as energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

-- Question #3: What artists have mulitiple songs in the top 48 songs?

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY artist_name asc

-- Question #4: How does a song's "song key" correspond to its ranking?

SELECT id, track_name, song_key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY song_key desc
